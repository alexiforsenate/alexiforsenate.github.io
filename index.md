The Senate is the most powerful body in the University. It makes decisions about everything, from the way courses are delivered, to the state of the toilets. In theory the Senate should be there to make the University the best and most inclusive place it can be. Unfortunately, today’s Senate is presiding over something that looks more and more like a second-rate private college than a leading University.

As your representative I will make sure the Senate doesn't forget that the University exists for students, not the other way around.

My position is clear: It’s not good enough to treat students with disdain, like the University’s gutting of Sydney College of the Arts and privatisation of the veterinary teaching hospital. We deserve better.
You may hear claims that the corporate suits know how to best run a University. If the past year is anything to go by that couldn’t be anything further from the truth.

You needn’t look far to see the unprecedented failures by the Senate. From broken systems for reporting sexual harassment or requesting special consideration, to the ongoing mistreatment of international students and neglect for students with disabilities.

Make no mistake, I have the experience to hold the Senate to account. As an editor and reporter for Honi Soit I wrote a number of articles pushing back against the way the Senate has been doing business. I’ve also got a strong relationship with student leaders from a variety of political backgrounds and I will work with student organisations, and I will work closely with the USU and SRC to stand up for students.

Most importantly, though, I will be a representative for you, My door will always be open to you.
